# Slideshow

Slideshow is an extremely simplistic slideshow application for Windows. The aim of this project was to provide a way in Windows to show a slideshow of images in a classroom setting with as little effort as possible.

The other requirement was to be able to show some text on each of the images shown. This is done using the tags stored with images, specifically author and title tags. After editing the tags of each image to show the person and location, for example, Slideshow is then able to do what would normally be done with PowerPoint in a fraction of the time.

The work done is also transferable to other computers: edit the tags of the images, copy the images along with Slideshow to a thumbdrive, and use it anywhere without having to install anything.

## Requirements

A Windows XP/Vista/7/8 machine with a minimum of .NET Framework 4.8.

## Setup

Download the latest version of Slideshow from the [releases page](https://github.com/tetsuo13/Slideshow/releases). There are two ways of launching the slideshow:

1. Save the application in the same folder as the images you wish to use. From here you can start Slideshow and it will simply display all images it finds (JPG or JPEG).
2. Save the application anywhere and drag-and-drop one or more images on top to start Slideshow. It will display just those images.

If you want to show any text along with the images you'll need to edit the EXIF information for each image. There are dozens of applications freely available online that will help but Windows also provides a way when bringing up the properties of an image.

Currently, the only tags that are used are:

* Authors
* Title

When one or both of these tags are populated, they are shown at the bottom-right of the screen with the image. The order shown above is the same order as they are shown, with each on a separate line.

## Usage

By default each image is shown for a short period of time and then the next image is shown, with the entire set of images looping. Certain keys perform different functions however:

* `<Escape>`: Exit Slideshow.
* `<Left Arrow>`: Go to previous image.
* `<Right Arrow>`: Go to next image.
* `<Plus>`: Increase amount of time spent on each image. There is no limit to how large this can be. If you want to effectively pause on an image, hold down this key until a large amount of seconds is used.
* `<Minus>`: Decrease amount of time spent on each image. One second is the minimum amount of time required.

## Development Notes

Project embeds [ExifLib - A Fast Exif Data Extractor for .NET 2.0+](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36342/ExifLib-A-Fast-Exif-Data-Extractor-for-NET-2-0) by [Simon McKenzie](http://www.codeproject.com/Members/SimonMcKenzie) for all EXIF extractions. Embedding the source within the project over using the [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExifLib) package was chosen to keep the final binary distribution down to one file.
